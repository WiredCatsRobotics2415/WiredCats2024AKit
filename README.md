#WiredCats2024 as an AdvantageKit project

[AdvantageKit](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit) is a logging system for WPILib projects. Mechanical Advantage (team 6328) maintains it along with thier log viewer [AdvantageScope](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageScope). They have the best robot code framework that I have seen out there, so I've replicated it using our competition code for the 2024 season in this repo.
